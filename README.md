# diegorivera-com-es
Personal website

## Deployment

Just a static HTML/CSS/JS site to deploy by copying into a webserver's root directory.

It simulates a classic shell interpreter for the guest user to interact with the site content.

## Settings

Included .htaccess file will provide 404 redirection to the main page simulating a change to unexisting directory error (not valid for Nginx)
